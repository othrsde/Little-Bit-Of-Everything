# Little-Bit-Of-Everything
exactly as name states
old school programmer from late 80's. looking to further myself yet again.
mostly for self use but if I see something that catches me I will jump in on it.
mostly looking at Firmware for 3D printers and CNC equipment.
will be off to a slow start as i rarely have any time to get things done.
